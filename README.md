# NBA_Predictions
Collaborated with a group of 5 others to develop and train predictive models for end-of-season NBA games in 2023. We predicted number of offensive rebounds, point spread (home pts minus away pts), and total points scored (home pts plus away pts). The accuracy of our models were judged mased on the mean absolute error of applying the models to upcoming games. The models were created bprior to a week's worth of NBA games, and we had the following Mean Absolute Errors

Offensive Rebounds: 4.636
Spread: 13.239
Total Points: 17.597
